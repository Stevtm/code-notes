# Code Notes

This is a work-in progress application that will allow users to record their personal notes in Markdown and code snippets that are executable the browser.

The application is being built as part of the Udemy course React and Typescript: Build a Portfolio Project by Stephen Grider and will be modified from the exact course content with some personal touches.
